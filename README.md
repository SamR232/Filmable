# Filmable: Can you guess the movie? 🍿

This was one of my first projects using React during my time at Northcoders. On running the app, a random screenshot will appear (apologies if you see the same one twice, it is completely random!). All you need to do is guess the movie from the picture, please feel free to have a try, there a quite a few to have a go at.

p.s the movies aren't case sensitive so unfortunately if its incorrect you can't blame that!

# How to run 🏃‍♂️

- Clone the repo on to your machine locally

### In the terminal

- Run yarn
- Run yarn run start
- Good Luck!

# Future updates 🤔

- Tidy up the App.js folder by removing the film array in to its own folder.
- Introduce Typescript to the project to get correct typing and avoid errors.
- Next would be to use an API to generate the image and movie titles, as currently these are an array of local images & titles which are then randomized.
- The CSS could definitely do with an improvement!
- Deploy the site once I'm happy with everything
