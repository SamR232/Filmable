# Filmable: Can you guess the movie? 🍿

This was one of my first projects using React during my time at Northcoders. On running the app, a random screenshot will appear (apologies if you see the same one twice, it is completely random!). All you need to do is guess the movie from the picture, please feel free to have a try,there a quite a few to have a go at!

# How to run 🏃‍♂️

- Clone the repo on to your machine locally
- Run NPM install ( their are legacy dependencies in there as this project is now a year old)
- Run npm run start
- Good Luck!

# Future updates 🤔

- The first would be to update all dependencies to bring this project into 2023 (possibly using yarn instead)
- Next would be to use an API to generate the image and movie titles, as currently these are an array of images & titles which gets pulled and randomised locally.
- The CSS could definitely do with an improvement to!
